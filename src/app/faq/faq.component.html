	<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What is it supposed to do?</h4>
	<p class="list-group-item-text">
		Photo Recall is a memory game.  Users are shown an image for a brief duration, then answer questions about the content.  After sign-up, users can play unlimited sessions.  Users can apply to be Game Masters, and build and post their own sessions.  
	</p>
</div>

<div class="list-group">
	<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What can it actually do?</h4>
	<p class="list-group-item-text">
		Currently, users can sign-up, sign-in, logout, read this FAQ, see early builds of a game session, and see how creating a game session may work. User info persists to the DB, although I delete the user collection often.  Game sessions can't be saved.

		There are a lot of aspects of Angular 2 that are expected to change. So currently I'm focused on the functionality that seems most stable and is well documented.
