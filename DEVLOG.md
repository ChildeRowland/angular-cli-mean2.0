Experimented with how ng build creates the dist folder.  For the time being, the express server file has to be directly in the src file.  When I put it in another child folder, like src/server/app.js, the complier throws syntax errors, even though the proper file is being sent.

Server sub-folder seem to work fine for models and routes.

Deployed the application to Heroku:
1. use the ng build command in the terminal
2. copy the package.json file into the /dist folder
3. add the script "start": "node app.js" to package.json
4. remove the other scripts from package.json
5. $ git init / git add -A / git commit
6. $ heroku git:remote -a fast-hamlet-44674 
7. git push heroku master

Problems:
1. ng build rewrites everything in the dist folder, so this has to be done for every deploy.

Set up angular-cli and simple express server.

Run the server in the terminal $ node dist/app
